            That Podcast started in a way most podcasts probably start. Dave suggested some podcasts for Beau to check out. Beau hadn't really listened to podcasts before but he really dug the ones Dave recommended. They talked it over and decided to start one themselves. Boom. That Podcast was born.
        </p>
        <p>
             We talk about it a bit in Episode 1 if you want to check it out. Really, we just want to talk to each other and share our discussions with others in the hopes that it might help in some way.
        </p>
        <p>
            A common question we get asked when we were starting up was, "what are you going to talk about?" Pretty much everything is on the table. We're both dads. We're both programmers. So really, "life?"
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of the day we're are doing this for us but we hope that we can bring something else to others. We <strong>do</strong> hope you enjoy it!
